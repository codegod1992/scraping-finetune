QUESTION: What is stripe?


PASSAGE: debits the balance needed to meet your minimum from your bank account. The minimum payment process is automatic and requires no action on your part. You can also make manual payments towards your minimum through your dashboard following the Make payment option.What happens if I cant meet a minimum on time?Reach out to support, and well work with you to help you meet your obligation.What happens if I miss my minimums for multiple payment periods?Well work with you to help you get back on track and meet your loan obligations. If you continue to miss your minimums, we may take additional action, as detailed in your loan contract.What happens if I meet my minimum for the payment period?If youve satisfied the minimum for the current period, we will continue to withhold repayments from your daily sales.How do you apply repayments to my loan balance and my minimum?We first apply your loan repayments to repay the past due balance, if any, and then to pay down your balance in the current payment period. We dont apply repayments above your minimum to your future payment periods.ExamplesHere are two example scenarios to help you understand how the minimum payment process works.Example 1: You successfully meet your minimum through daily sales deductions. Your minimum amount is 2,000 USD for the 60-day period ending on March 1.In that period, you repaid 2,500 USD of your loan balance through Stripe deducting a fixed percentage of your sales volume (the repayment rate).Youve successfully met your minimum. We will continue to withhold repayments during this payment period to pay down your total loan balance.In the next 60-day period, you still must meet the minimum of 2,000 USD.Example 2: You dont meet your minimum through daily sales deductions. Your minimum is 2,000 USD for the 60-day period ending on March 1.In that period, you repaid 1,500 USD of your loan balance through Stripe deducting a fixed percentage of your sales volume (the repayment rate).On March 1, youll be required to pay the remaining balance of your minimum, which in this case is 500 USD (2,000 USD - 1,500 USD = 500 USD).On March 1, Stripe will automatically debit 500 USD from your bank account to meet your minimum.CollateralIs collateral required to obtain a Stripe Capital loan?In general, Stripe Capital doesnt require collateral for loans in the amount of 150,000 USD or less or for loans in good standing. For loans with amounts over 150,000 USD or certain delinquent loans, we might file a UCC-1 statement in the state where your business is located to take a security interest in your business assets.What is a UCC statement?A UCC-1 statement is a publicly available notice filed by a creditor that secures the creditors interest in certain assets of a debtor. Creditors file UCC-1 statements with the secretary of state where a business debtor is incorporated at the time a loan first originates.How do I get a UCC filing released after Stripe Capital filed a UCC-1 statement on my business?After you finish paying off your loan, you can reach out to us with a request to terminate a UCC-1 filing.What if I was asked about a UCC lien but I dont recognize the secured party?Creditors sometimes use a third party to file and maintain lien positions as the registered agent of the creditor. Wolters Kluwer is Stripe Capitals third-party representative. If youre unsure of what creditor the third party is acting on behalf of, we recommend that you contact the third party directly.Was this page helpful?YesNoQuestions?
