RESPONSE:

Stripe Elements is a platform that businesses can use to easily establish their online stores. Each store owner that uses the platform to collect payments is a connected account. There are three types of connected accounts on Stripe: Standard, Custom, and Express. The current version of Treasury supports only Custom connected accounts. Financial accounts can be created and attached to connected accounts in a one to one relationship using the Stripe API. Treasury financial accounts have routing numbers because they are backed by US banking partners, and balances are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance. The financial accounts of your platform's connected accounts can be funded, as well as money moved between them. If your platform uses Stripe Issuing, you can provide payment cards linked to the financial account balance of your connected accounts.
