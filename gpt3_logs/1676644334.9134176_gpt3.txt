How do I do that?We recommend that you calculate the percentage of revenue that youd like to allocate and set a custom fixed monthly contribution amount in the Climate settings page of your Dashboard. If you update the amount prior to the first of the next months billing cycle, you can adjust it as your revenue grows.

What are my options?Thanks for your interest! Anyone can contribute directly to Stripe Climate here.My percentage of revenue suggestions dont seem to understand my revenue correctly. What do I do?Stripe Climate suggests percentage of revenue options based off of the revenue you process through Stripe. If the listed options are too high or low, you can set a custom percentage contributionor set a fixed monthly contribution. If you run into this issue, please let us know so that we can improve the suggested contribution calculation for all businesses.What happens if I set a fixed contribution where the amount is greater than my Stripe balance on the date the contribution is debited?This scenario will bring your account balance negative, which may result in your bank account being debited so that your Stripe balance is whole again. To avoid this, you can proactively add to your balance ahead of the contribution, which is debited on the first of the month. In these cases, Stripe sends you an email notification reminding you to top-up before a debit takes your balance negative.Was this page helpful?YesNoQuestions?
