QUESTION: What is stripe?


PASSAGE: appended to the statement descriptor prefix set in the Stripe Dashboard. An asterisk (*) and an empty space are also added to separate the default statement descriptor from the dynamic portion. These two characters count towards the 22 character limit.Storing information in metadata Stripe supports adding metadata to the most common requests you make, such as processing payments. Metadata isnt shown to customers or factored into whether or not a payment is declined or blocked by our fraud prevention system.Through metadata, you can associate other information thats meaningful to you with Stripe activity.Any metadata you include is viewable in the Dashboard (for example, when looking at the page for an individual payment), and is also available in common reports. As an example, you can attach the order ID for your store to the PaymentIntent for that order. Doing so allows you to easily reconcile payments in Stripe to orders in your system.If youre using Radar for Fraud Teams, consider passing any additional customer information and order information as metadata.By doing so, you can write Radar rules using metadata attributes and have more information available within the Dashboard, which can expedite your review process.When a PaymentIntent creates a charge, the PaymentIntent copies its metadata to the charge. Subsequent updates to the PaymentIntents metadata wont modify the metadata of charges previously created by the PaymentIntent.curlStripe CLIRubyPythonPHPJavaNodeGo.NETCommand Linecurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \  -u sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc: \  -d amount=1099 \  -d currency=usd \  -d payment_method_types[]=card \  -d metadata[order_id]=6735Dont store any sensitive information (personally identifiable information, card details, and so on) as metadata or in the description parameter of the PaymentIntent.See alsoCollecting One-time PaymentsSaving and Reusing CardsUsing Payment Intents on iOSUsing Payment Intents on AndroidWas this page helpful?YesNoQuestions?
