RESPONSE:

Stripe is a company that provides a suite of tools for developers to use in order to accept payments and manage financial operations for their businesses. These tools include an online payment gateway, a subscription management system, an invoicing system, and a point-of-sale system. Stripe also offers a number of SDKs and APIs that developers can use to integrate Stripe's functionality into their own applications.
