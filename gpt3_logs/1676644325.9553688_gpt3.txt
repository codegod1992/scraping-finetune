RESPONSE:

Stripe is a software platform that allows businesses to accept and manage payments. Stripe provides a set of tools and services that businesses can use to customize their fraud protection, set risk scores, create lists of trusted customers, and modify criteria that instructs Radar to allow, block, review, or request 3DS authentication. Stripe also allows businesses to handle manual reviews of suspicious payments.
