DETAILED ANSWER:

RESPONSE:

Stripe is a platform that helps businesses accept and manage payments. Stripe Identity is a feature of the platform that helps businesses verify the identities of their customers. To use Stripe Identity, businesses first need to collect some basic information from their customers, such as their name and address. They then need to submit this information to Stripe for verification. Once Stripe has verified the customer's identity, the business can then access verification results through the Stripe API.
