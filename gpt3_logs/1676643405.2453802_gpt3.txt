Other advanced pricing models arent supported.Product and price limitsYou can configure the pricing table to display a maximum of four products, with up to three prices per product. Only three unique pricing intervals can be configured across all products.Account creationThe pricing table call-to-action takes customers directly to checkout. It doesnt currently support adding an intermediate step (for example, asking the customer to create an account on your website before checking out).Rate limitThe pricing table has a rate limit of up to 50 read operations per second. If you have multiple pricing tables, the rate limit is shared. Support for a higher rate limit is coming soon.Checkout redirectThe pricing table cant redirect customers to checkout if your website provider sandboxes the embed code in an iframe without the allow-top-navigation attribute enabled. Contact your website provider to enable this setting.Testing the pricing table locallyThe pricing table requires a website domain to render. To test the pricing table locally, run a local HTTP server to host your websites index.html file over the localhost domain. To run a local HTTP server, use Pythons SimpleHTTPServer or the http-server npm module.Was this page helpful?YesNoQuestions?
